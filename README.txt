# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning models. The primary tasks involve:
1. **Regression**: Building models to predict the actual prices of houses.
2. **Classification**: Categorizing house prices into different price levels based on a threshold.

The project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms to understand and predict housing market trends.

## Project Files
- Regression Model.ipynb: Notebook containing regression models for predicting house prices.
- Classification Model.ipynb: Notebook containing classification models to categorize house prices.
- realest.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup.

## Dataset
The dataset `realest.csv` includes features related to house attributes, such as location, area, and number of rooms. It is used across both regression and classification tasks. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the notebooks to load the data successfully.

## Models Used

### Regression Models
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

### Classification Models
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model is evaluated based on relevant metrics, and the best-performing models are highlighted in the results.
